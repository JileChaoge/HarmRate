Description: Provides tools for quantifying individual-level treatment risk for binary outcomes, with a focus
    on the harm rate. It includes functions to estimate the harm rate given a specified correlation
    coefficient between potential outcomes, and to calculate the classical Fréchet–Hoeffding bounds 
    for both the harm rate and the correlation coefficient.
